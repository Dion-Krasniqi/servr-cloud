# serv-r
Serv-r Storage is an open-source cloud storage platform. This repo makes up the frontend built with NextJs.
It only communicates with the Python API which then does the further routing needed. Currently, the styling
is not really standardised but the functionality is there(at least for the parts available on the backend).
