Serv-r is an open-source Cloud Storage Solution platform.

Current plan is to build the frontend using NextJs, create most of the frontend functionality and use Appwrite to get the logic of the backend down on a small scale. After, start migrating most of if not all of the backend to a self-hosted solution, not sure about the framework though.
